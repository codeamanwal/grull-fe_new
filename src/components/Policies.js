        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How Do We Use Your Email Address?
</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order.

</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?
</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">{`We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Grull.work to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.`}</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How Do We Protect Your Information?
</h2>
        <p className='mb-8'>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Grull.work or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Could my information be transferred to other countries?
</h2>
        <p className='mb-8'>Grull.work is incorporated in United States. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Is the information collected through the Grull.work Service secure?</h2>
<p className="mb-8">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Can I update or correct my information?</h2>
<p className="mb-8">The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Grull.work collects depend on your relationship with Grull.work. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.</p>

To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
<p className="mb-8">You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
<p className="mb-8">If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>

<p className="mb-8">We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>

<h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">What is GDPR?</h3>
<p className="mb-8">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>

<h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents.</h3>
<p className="mb-8">Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>

<h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">What is personal data?</h3>
<p className="mb-8">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>

<h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</h3>
<ul className="mb-8 list-disc pl-5">
  <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
  <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
  <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
  <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why is GDPR important?</h2>
<p className="mb-8">{`GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individual's personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Grull.work we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.`}</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">{`Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion`}</h2>
<p className="mb-8">We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Grull.work processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>

<p className="mb-8">{`We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.`}</p>
